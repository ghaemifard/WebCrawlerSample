# WebCrawlerSample
 
This repository is a simple web carwler for CNN and Twitter websites. It extracts latest tweets from a specific ID, and latest CNN articles, and then shows them in a single web page. 

  - Viewing latest tweets and CNN articles in a single page
  - Not using any data storage (it can lead to performance issues though)
  - Searching for a keyword in CNN articles and limiting the results

# New Features!

  - Configuring the web crawler so as to fetch any desired data 

There is a form in the top of the web page, which can be used to specify the keyword you are interested in, on CNN web pages (the default value is 'trump'). Also we can get the latest tweets of anyone in Tweeter.
